# Foundations of JS
Before fully diving into JS, you must know Bash and Git; they are the foundations of the JS work you will be doing.
Once you complete each checkbox, you will open a 'Pull Request' (PR) on this repo, checking [x] each of the boxes in this README that you've completed.
I will then test you on your knowledge of the course in that checkbox. If you pass the quiz, I will merge your PR and you'll move to the next tutorial.

For a text editor, use VSCode (we've already installed it on your computer). If you have any questions about VSCode, these are good resources:
  - [Intro to VSCode by Microsoft](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)
  - [VSCode tips and tricks](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-tips-and-tricks)

### 1. Bash
- [ ] Take [this tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/).
  - Complete (at least) the first three modules, up until 'User Input!'.
  - Make sure you thoroughly understand the material of those first three modules.

### 2. Git
- [ ] Completely finish [this tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).
  - Ensure that you thoroughly understand the material of the full course.

### 3. JS
- [ ] This ['Intro to JS'](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) course is a good starting point for JavaScript.
  - Complete the first nine modules (including and up to 'Classes').
  - If you feel like you want to test your knowledge while you go, you can pay for the 'Pro' version (a fairly worthwhile investment).

Once you complete the first nine modules of the above tutorial, I will quiz you and create a mini project to test your knowledge of Bash, Git, and JS.
