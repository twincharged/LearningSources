# Foundations of JS
Before fully diving into JS, you must know Bash and Git; they are the foundations of the JS work you will be doing.
Once you complete each checkbox, you will open a 'Pull Request' (PR) on this repo, checking [x] each of the boxes in this README that you've completed.
I will then test you on your knowledge of the course in that checkbox. If you pass the quiz, I will merge your PR and you'll move to the next tutorial.

For a text editor, use VSCode (Sobhan: we've already installed it on your computer). If you have any questions about VSCode, these are good resources:
  - [Intro to VSCode by Microsoft](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)
  - [VSCode tips and tricks](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-tips-and-tricks)
